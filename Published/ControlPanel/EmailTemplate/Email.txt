Dear {0},

Hope you are all fine and enjoying life. We are very much thankful to all of you to ensure your monthly donations for the better future of orphan children under the sponsorship of SAVE DC. We should like to inform you that due to summer vocation/summer camps in schools, we could not be able to update the monthly reports of students from June 2012 to August 2012 . All the Schools will be open on 1st September 2012. We will add the annual result cards of students as soon as possible in SAVE DC Software than you can check the details.

Thank you so much for your kind cooperation.

Thanks!
